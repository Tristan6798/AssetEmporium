Assets should be placed under the asset contents portion of the asset template, and asset details should have the name of the
asset, the creator(s), and a description.

Assets should be paired with a document detailing how to operate it, as well as in a folder with the prefab itself and
everything it requires. The following is paired with the example asset template.

World Portal Select

For calibration, all that is needed is to duplicate the world slot for each world you are adding. In each slot object, fill in
the data relative to entry (world ID goes in ID, name is however you wish to name it, image is what will show up on the menu.
TargetChild and IsRoom do not need to be modified.)
